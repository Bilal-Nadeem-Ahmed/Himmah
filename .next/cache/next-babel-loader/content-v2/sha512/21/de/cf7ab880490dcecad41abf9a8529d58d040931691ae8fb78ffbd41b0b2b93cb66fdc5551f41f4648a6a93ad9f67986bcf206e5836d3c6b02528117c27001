As part of the project we are held a exhibition at the New Art Exchange, Nottingham.  In the exhibition, we examine the period of the two Great Wars, and attempt to contextualise the Eurocentric war narrative within a broader black and Asian history. </p>\n            <br/>\n         \n            <p><b>The process of public remembrance, through memorials, books, films and paintings, has  created a national narrative without the presence of  black and Asian soldiers, not only in this country, but also in many of the former colonies. </b></p>\n            <br/>\n           \n            <p><b>A better sense of a shared global history is imperative if we want to understand each other. </b></p>\n            <br/>\n          \n            <p><b>At the end of the Second  World War, Germany, India, Palestine and West Africa, would be partitioned and most political boundaries across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East would be altered.</b></p>\n            <br/>\n            <p><b>In this process, millions of people died or were forcibly displaced, and this legacy continues to the present day. </b></p>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <p>Artists Jagdish Patel and Farida Makki have been worked with local families to explore the connections between Nottingham’s Muslim community and the wider war narrative. In this exhibition we use personal memory, maps, photographs, and archival material to pose questions about the process of war memorialisation, empire, and its interconnections to our present-day identities.</p>\n            <p><a href='http://www.nae.org.uk'>More details here..</a></p>\n          </div>\n      </main>\n\n\n      <footer className={styles.footer}>\n      <Footer/>\n      </footer>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
